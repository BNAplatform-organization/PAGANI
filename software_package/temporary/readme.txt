We placed a .bat file for directly calling multi-core BFS allgorithm with .exe format. This algorithm doesn't need GPU cluster. The command line script is writen
as follows:
            .\\BFS_MulCPU.exe F:\trial 0 b
where F:\trial is the directory of all the CSR files. What you guys need to do is just to replace this parameter with your own path of CSR files and keep other parameters unaltered.
