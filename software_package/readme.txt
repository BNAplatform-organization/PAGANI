Here, we developed a parallel graph-theoretical analysis toolkit (PAGANI Toolkit) aiming at fast mapping of voxel-level human brain connectomes, using a hybrid CPU-GPU accelerated framework.
Notably, 
1.Majority of functions of PAGANI toolkit is able to be called via GUI except for high-resolution network construction functions.
2.Currently users is suggested to run network construction pocedures on command lines and network analysis procedures by GUI. Regarding cmd tutorials, see .\exefiles_weighted\readmeOnMapDenseConnectomes.txt
3.If users have demands to handle larger connectomes (e.g., with voxel-resolutions equal or less than 2mm), please contact us to gain advanced versions of PAGANI.
Best regards.
